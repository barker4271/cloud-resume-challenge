# Frontend technical specification

- Create a static website that serves an HTML resume

##Resume format considerations

- Downloadable resumes need to be in PDF format
- Resumes should not include content such as a photo, gender, religion or other information that could be used for discrimination
- I will use the harvard resume template for this exercise

Used ChatGPT to generate a professional style resume using a modern, simple, clean design — no shadows, no cards, no heavy styling — just clean typography, light dividers, balanced spacing, and soft accents.  No CSS framework.

Used W3C Linter to clean up html

No need for a local ws?
