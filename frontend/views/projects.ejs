/--- Project content.  Loaded from data.json for now, eventually will include a link to a page for creating project records, storing then in dynamoDB, the loading them from there --/

<div class="card">
  <p class="lead">A collection of things I’ve built, worked on, or documented as part of my learning journey.</p>
